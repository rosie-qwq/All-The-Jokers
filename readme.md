# PSA
always download from releases page first, then main if that isnt working, and only then from dev, if you go straight to main or dev then u might encounter problems!
also if you want help or want to help or maybe just wanna chat about balatro modpacks, check out the official ATJ discord server: https://discord.gg/zJGDf3P3N8

# Instructions

0. have love injector 8.0 (and the lua51.dll file) on ur balatro steamapps directory for the love of GOD!! its steamapps/common/balatro/version.dll IF YOU DONT HAVE THAT DONT COMPLAIN (pls)
1. move ur saves OUT OF appdata/roaming/balatro if u care about ur current achievements in the base/modded game u have, otherwise just delete everything in ur appdata/roaming/balatro folder except the steam_autocloud.vdf file
2. DONT REPLACE FILES EVER, that causes CORRUPTIONS, always make sure youve deleted the original!!!!!
3. make sure to put ALL the files in the modpack folder in ur appdata/roaming/balatro folder!!! yes even the fucking game configs, because the game has MEMORY LEAKS WHEN PLAYED IN FULLSCREEN!!!!!
4. have fun and pray to god it works on ur machine lmao

btw if the modpack crashes when u try to start, disable ur steam's auto cloudsave, delete the savefiles again (aka the 1, 2 and 3 files), start the game, then re-enable cloudsave, that should fix it hopefully!! (btw u can delete the (aka the E1 file) too if it isnt compatible, im not always micromanaging every file sorrgy)

# Credits

all the respective mod devs of course for developing their mods, without them this wouldnt be possible in the slightest, i will make a list of all project leads of each mod eventually! (if i were to list every artist who worked on each mod the list would be 42 pages long so i hope yall understand that -w-')

hi4220 for helping me debug the modpack and for mod suggestions
and for all the other people in discord who were enthusiastic when i showed them this, instead of putting up a frown and telling me itd never work
and myself for somehow not going insane while making this (well, actually i did almost go to a mental hospital in the midst of making this modpack but thats personal stuff and TOTALLY isnt related to overworking myself on this, trust)
