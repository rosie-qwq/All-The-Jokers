# instructions, fucking read!!!!
0. have love injector 8.0 on ur balatro steamapps directory for the love of GOD!! its steamapps/common/balatro/version.dll IF YOU DONT HAVE THAT DONT COMPLAIN (pls)
1. move ur saves OUT OF appdata/roaming/balatro if u care about ur current achievements in the base/modded game u have, otherwise just delete everything in ur appdata/roaming/balatro folder except the steam_autocloud.vdf file
2. DONT REPLACE FILES EVER, that causes CORRUPTIONS, always make sure youve deleted the original!!!!!
3. make sure to put ALL the files in the modpack folder in ur appdata/roaming/balatro folder!!! yes even the fucking game configs, because the game has MEMORY LEAKS WHEN PLAYED IN FULLSCREEN!!!!!
4. have fun and pray to god it works on ur machine lmao

btw if the modpack crashes when u try to start, disable ur steam's auto cloudsave, delete the savefiles again, start the game, then re-enable cloudsave, that should fix it hopefully!! (btw u can delete the modded save too if it isnt compatible, im not always micromanaging every file sorrgy)

# disclaimers

credits go to all the mods's creators and devs nd so on, im only jumbling these together and making frankeinstein edits to them sometimes in hope they work together, but 90% of the time its still just all the mod author's work so go ahead and check their mods nd profiles and star and share their repos too!!
