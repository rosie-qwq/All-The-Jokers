### Current Content
- **320+ New Jokers**:  From hits like Titanic, E.T. and Iron Man to unnotable and unremarkable flops like The Three Musketeers (2011) and Krazy House. With many more jokers planned.
- **8 Enhancement:** A slew of new enhancements inspired by movie genres to help really sell that flavour. Sacrifice cards with Demonic cards, awaken monsters with Horror cards, fall in love with Romance cards, and more!
- **New Seals, Spectrals, And Planets**
- **New Consumable: Confections!** Popcorn, soda and cookies. Items to nourish your run and give them a little boost.
- **New Mechanics:** Earn extra joker slots by playing movies of the same genre. Start slinging spells. Even alien abduction!

### FAQ:
*I'm here to look at the code and see if I can learn from it for my own mod. What can I take?*
If the function credits any user that is not 'IcyEthics', you may want to ask that user if you can use their code. But otherwise, you're free to copy, adapt, improve or ruin any code in this repository. Same goes for art assets, unless they're credited to another user that isn't me. I'd love to receive credit, but it's not a necessity. As all the art in this mod is based on or traced from copyrighted materials, do be aware that you're not allowed to monetize the use of it. But I shouldn't have to tell you that technically I don't own Remy the rat from Ratatouille. If you end up using anything, I'd love to know about it, though, so please let me know!

*Is this mod balanced?*
Not yet, at least. I've not focused on balancing yet at all. Feedback on balancing is encouraged and welcomed!

*What other Mods is Balatro Goes Kino compatible with?*
None! Not intentionally, at least. You can definitely play it with other mods, and feel free to report compatibility related crashes, but be aware that the mod has not yet focused on compatibility with other mods.

*I found a bug, what do I do?*
Please let me know by opening a discussion here, or posting in the Balatro Goes Kino thread on the official Balatro discord. Or, if you want to follow and give feedback on the mod more actively, join the mod's discord: https://discord.gg/jQQKUurk8K
