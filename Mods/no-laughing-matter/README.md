It is a WIP, so there isnt much yet, but we work to add more and more as fast as we can.<br>
So far there is only 11 Jokers (with few more ready for next update), but there is already 35 planned, and the number is ever growing. Plans also incloude 2 new consumable card packs, and who knows if we come up with other new stuff
