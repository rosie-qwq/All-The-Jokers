# BLAST OFF
Pack your bags, Jimbo's going to the moon! **Jimbo's Moon Vacation** is a modest vanilla-like content expansion mod for Balatro, adding two new powerful consumable types, a handful of Jokers, and plenty of new blinds to put your ~~reckless gambling~~ critical thinking skills to the test!
Designed to blend as smoothly as possible with vanilla Balatro, building off of existing mechanics while bringing in fresh ideas that open up new strategies.

# Featured Content
- 2 new Consumable Types:
  - 13 Lunar Cards! A set of uncommon moon-themed cards that permanently upgrade the values of *individual card ranks,* analagous to Planet cards.
  - 22 Reverse Tarot Cards! Rare, powerful counterparts to tarot cards with stronger effectsâ€”often with an interesting twist. Like a Spectral Card and a Tarot Card had an upside-down child.
- 8 Booster Packs, 2 Tags, 3 Spectral Cards, and 2 Seals to interact with Lunar and Reverse Cards
- 16 new Jokers:
  - 5 Common Jokers
  - 5 Uncommon Jokers
  - 5 Rare Jokers
  - and 1 brand-spanking-new Legendary Joker!
- 17 new Blinds:
  - 12 Boss Blinds sure to poke new and interesting holes in your once-indestructible builds
  - 5 Finisher Blinds to both challenge you and test your patience

# Configurable!
Are Lunar Cards diluting your shop pool? Have a different Reverse Tarot Card mod you like better? Blinds pissing you off? Hate my Jokers?
*Fear not...* JMV is fully configurable. You can turn off individual features as you like from the mod config menu. Happy configuring!

## Who made this confounded thing, anyway?
idk

## Any plans for more?
Maybe! I have more ideas for Jokers I want to add, but I'm abysmally slow at making the art. Stay tuned for new additions.
