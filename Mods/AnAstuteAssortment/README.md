Hello all, AAA here.

First off: huge shoutouts to Revo and ThunderEdge for the coding and implementation of this mod! Without them it would still just be a collection of PNGs, .pixil files, and a Notes file on my laptop :)

Secondly: this mod features 28 new Jokers and 7 new Spectral cards for Balatro. They'll hopefully slot right into the vanilla content of the base game and will be fun to use and utilize!

There's too many to list them all here, but some highlights include:
