# TOGA's Stuff
A personal timewaster project that is a mod for Balatro.

[Download the latest release here.](https://github.com/TheOneGoofAli/TOGAPackBalatro/releases/latest)

Don't forget to check mod config menu, especially on first load or fresh profile.

Uses Steamodded 1.0.0-BETA and a bit of Lovely patching.
https://github.com/Steamodded/smods

Talisman 2.2.0 (development builds work too) is an optional dependency as of 1.0.2.
https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Talisman

If Incantation is to be used alongside, please obtain the [forked version](https://github.com/TheOneGoofAli/JensBalatroCollection/tree/main/Incantation) to prevent unintended behaviour by some of the Consumeables of this mod.
Alternatively, why not check out [Overflow](https://github.com/lord-ruby/Overflow) as a modern replacement?

_Please use the source code download options for grabbing the mod._ That way, I don't have to remake the 7z archive every single time.
