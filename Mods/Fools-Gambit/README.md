Fool's Gambit is an unused title for Balatro. This mod aims to add (some)new jokers, packs and alternate effects to basically every Balatro gimmick, including:
- Alternative effects for ~~all~~ some jokers, tarots and spectrals
- New jokers (with alternate counter-parts)
- A new consumable type.
- New seal~~s~~
- Alternate editions
- An alternate ~~soundtrack and~~ SFX

Currently, there is little new content. Alternating has been implemented, and we're working on implementing the effects; pace should pick up Very soon!
