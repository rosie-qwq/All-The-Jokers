A Balatro mod I made because I was bored and needed something to work on.
This mod introduces:
 - New Jokers (mostly) based on references to other things, somewhat balanced compared to vanilla Jokers
 - A new "transmutation" mechanic that transmutes Jokers into more powerful Transmuted Jokers that exceed the power of Legendary jokers
 - Enhancements, Seals and Stickers associated with these Transmuted Jokers
 - New Tarot and Spectral cards to add more variety to the overall Balatro experience

> :page_facing_up: Note: Compatibility with other mods is **not** guaranteed.

## Future Steps

- [ ] Get *human-made* art for everything in this mod
- [ ] ~~Ensure compatibility with Talisman~~
- [ ] Create transmutations for other modded Jokers
