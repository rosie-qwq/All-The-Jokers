INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE – MASTER BEDROOM – NIGHT

Dark. Quiet.
PETER GRIFFIN groans loudly, shifting uncomfortably under the covers. He clutches his stomach and rolls from side to side. 
Peter gets out of bed, starting to walk to the door.

LOIS sits up.

LOIS
It's the middle of the night...
Where are you going?

PETER
I'm sick of all this healthy crap.
I'm going downstairs to find something good to eat.
And then I'm gonna fall asleep watching transvaginal mesh lawsuit commercials.

Peter walks out of frame.

CUT TO:

INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE – KITCHEN – NIGHT

The room is dark and silent. Peter enters and flips on the light.

The sudden brightness reveals CHRIS, sitting at the dining table. Every cabinet and drawer is wide open.

CHRIS
(flatly)
There’s nothing.

PETER
Thank you, son.

Peter reaches for the light switch, flips it off and walks out of the kitchen.

The kitchen goes dark again. Peter exits, leaving Chris alone at the table.
