# FAQ

**How do I open and close the menu?**

Press [TAB] while in-game, or use the 'DebugPlusPlus' button in the pause menu. (Can be toggled in the mod settings menu).


**DebugPlus' menu gets stuck when I release [TAB].**

Hold [TAB] for around 0.2 seconds when opening and closing the menu.


**There is a weird green box blocking the right side of the screen.**

Same as above. This is due to a weird interaction with DebugPlus and DebugPlusPlus (this mod).


**I found a bug/want to suggest a feature.**

Report/suggest it inside the dedicated thread in the offical Balatro's discord server.
