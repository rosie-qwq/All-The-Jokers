# Finity
A Balatro mod that is all about befriending your foes

This mod adds a new joker rarity, "Showdown", jokers of this rarity are unique and only obtainable in the shop after defeating the relative showdown blind, altough there are ways to obtain them earlier, this means that these jokers spice up runs that continue through endless.
