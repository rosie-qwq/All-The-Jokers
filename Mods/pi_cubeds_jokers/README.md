pi_cubed's Jokers is a relatively lightweight mod with minimal lovely patching and hooks. As a result, there should be few crashes due to conflicts with other mods. Feel free to reach out to me via the link above if problems do occur!

## Config Options
A game restart is required for Config options to take effect.

### New Spectral Cards  
This option enables or disables the Spectral Cards Commander, Rupture, and Extinction from appearing.

### New Tags
This option enables or disables the Rebound Tag from appearing.

### Custom Sound Effects  
Enables or disables any custom sound effects I've implemented into the mod. Currently, this affects Rhythmic Joker, Explosher, On-beat, Off-beat, Pot, Talking Flower, "Monkey See, Monkey Do", and Otamatone.

### Hand type-affecting Jokers
Enables or disables any Jokers that directly change your hand and what poker hands it contains. Certain mods that tinker with poker hands can cause crashes or game closures when these Jokers activate. This option is **automatically disabled if the Paperback mod is active**. Currently, this affects Mount Joker, Wee Mini, and Round-a-bout.

### ÞeAutumnCircus by AutumnMood  
ÞeAutumnCircus is a very unique content mod, and pi_cubed's Jokers adds 2 new Jokers using some of its mechanics, with theming based on Splatoon 3: Side Order! "Why?" Uh, 'cause it's like an expansion pack? It fit the vibe.
