lily's terrible balatro mod!

### Jokers
There are over 70 new jokers, nearly split between *Tauic* jokers and standalone jokers
What is a *Tauic* joker? they're a new type of joker, upgraded variants of normal jokers.
They are usually about as strong as an Exotic joker from Cryptid

### Consumables
3 new types of consumables, planetoids, superplanets, and cataclysm cards!
Planetoids are simply better variants of planet cards, and superplanets are extremely powerful, but very rare planet cards.
Cataclysm cards are consumables with a massive upside and downside, they can help greatly, or make you lose if you aren't careful.

### Decks
4 new decks, I won't list their effects, go find out for yourself!

### Mechanics
There are some new mechanics to understand in VallKarri.
First and foremost, if you score *way* too much on the boss blind, you will be sent forward multiple antes
You will still have to beat 8 total antes, even if you're sent forwards.

There's also meta-progression, many things will give xp, including playing on higher stakes, and you gain small bonuses based on your level!
