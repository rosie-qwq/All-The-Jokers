# Shenanigans's Decks
This mod currently adds 15 decks to the game (and 15 corresponding sleeves with unique effects, if using CardSleeves). You can either discover the effects yourself or read below for each deck's description.

5 decks are themed after the legendary jokers:
 - **Canio Deck**: Discarded cards have a 1 in 7 (increasable by Oops! All 6s) chance to be destroyed.
 - **Triboulet Deck**: Retrigger all Kings and Queens.
 - **Yorick Deck**: Discarded cards trigger their end of round effects. This works with Mime/Red Seal.
 - **Chicot Deck**: During the Boss Blind, your rightmost Joker triggers an additional time.
 - **Perkeo Deck**: After using four consumables, get a negative copy of one of them (chosen randomly).

The other current decks are themed after existing jokers/vouchers:
 - **Dusk Deck**: -1 hand per round, but each final hand is retriggered twice.
 - **Gros Michel Deck**: The leftmost non-eternal Joker has a 1 in 6 chance to be destroyed at end of round. Start with a Gros Michel.
 - **Hieroglyph Deck**: Start at ante 0, but must reach ante 10 to win.
 - **Freaky Deck**: Jokers are now freaky. (Each Joker is assigned as a 'Freaky 6', or 'Freaky 9'. After scoring, any 'Freaky 6' adjacent to a 'Freaky 9' gives 1.5x mult)
 - **Showman Deck**: Allows duplicate cards to appear, increases odds of that happening (every card generation has a chance to take from the pool of eligible cards you have instead of the regular pool)
 - **Snakeskin Deck**: After play or discard, always draw 3 cards (constant effect of The Serpent boss blind).
 - **Turtle Bean Deck**: +5 hand size, this bonus decreases by 1 after each discard/hand played. Resets after defeating the Boss Blind.
 - **Cartomancer Deck**: Create a specific Tarot card when Blind is selected, changes each Ante (so you essentially get 3 copies of it per Ante if you don't skip).
 - **Diplopia Deck**: Start with 2 copies of each card.
 - **Riff-raff Deck**: Start with ANY random eternal joker. (instead of taking pool weights into consideration every joker has equal odds of appearing, including legendaries!) (the joker needs to have eternal compat)

There is support for Card Sleeves! Every deck has its associated sleeve with an unique effect when using it with that deck. Sleeve unique effects are:
 - **Canio Sleeve**: +1 hand size for every 5 cards destroyed.
 - **Triboulet Sleeve**: Jacks are converted into Kings or Queens (chosen randomly) (jacks effectively never appear).
 - **Yorick Sleeve**: After playing 2 hands, gain 1 discard.
 - **Chicot Sleeve**: Prevent death during the Boss Blind (once per run).
 - **Perkeo Sleeve**: The fourth consumable will always be the one copied.
 - **Dusk Sleeve**: -1 hand per round, each played card is retriggered once.
 - **Gros Michel Sleeve**: The 2nd leftmost non-eternal Joker has a 1 in 6 chance to be destroyed at end of round. +1 Joker Slot
 - **Hieroglyph Sleeve**: Start at ante -1, blind size increases by x0.2 each Ante.
 - **Freaky Sleeve**: Jokers are now freakier. (They can be assigned numbers from 0 to 9, and if adjacent jokers' numbers are ascending you get the bonus. You can also go for the 420 bonus...)
 - **Showman Sleeve**: Booster Packs always contain a card you own, if possible. (currently very likely doesn't work for modded booster packs)
 - **Snakeskin Sleeve**: Rerolling adds a card to the shop instead of replacing existing cards.
 - **Turtle Bean Sleeve**: +1 shop slots, -1 shop slots at the end of the shop. Resets after the Boss Blind.
 - **Cartomancer Sleeve**: Tarot cards you get have a 1 in 3 chance to become Negative.
 - **Diplopia Sleeve**: +1 Joker Slot. When you get a Joker, duplicate it. When a Joker is sold or destroyed, destroy all copies of it.
 - **Riff-raff Sleeve**: If the Joker from Riff-raff Deck has blueprint compat, get a copy of it. Otherwise, get ANY other random eternal Joker.
