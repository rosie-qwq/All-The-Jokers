# CardPronouns!
The mod everyone needed!

Adds pronouns to cards, because honestly I think we all needed it.

All cards now have their own pronouns, and playing cards even have three!
One based on their enhancement, suit, and rank

## For developers:
If you'd like to change the pronouns of a card, for any reason

Simply set the center's `pronouns` field to the key of a Pronoun

You can check if a card is masculine, feminine or neutral with the CardPronouns.has function

e.g. CardPronouns.has("feminine", "j_joker") will 

You may also initialize new pronoun sets & pronoun classifications via CardPronouns.Pronoun and CardPronouns.PronounClassification

Both require keys in their initialization, pronoun sets require a pronoun_table too
