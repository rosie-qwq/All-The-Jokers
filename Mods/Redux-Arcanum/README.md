## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

**Codex Arcanum** is a mod that aims to expand Balatro by adding a new type of consumable card: **Alchemical Cards**!

Alchemical cards possess powerful, but temporary abilities that you can use in a blind. Gain hands and discards mid-blind, duplicate cards, remove debuffs, and much more!

You can find a gallery of all the cards this mod adds here: https://jumbocarrot0.github.io/Redux-Arcanum/

The are a total of **24** alchemical cards!

The mod also adds **8 new jokers**, **4 new vouchers**, **7 new booster packs**, a **Tarot** card, a new **Boss Blind**, and a **Spectral** card, to expand the game and allow a smoother experience with alchemical cards.
